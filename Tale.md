Tale is the dialog editing component of GoNorth. You can access this by navigating to an npc in [Kortisto](/steffendx/GoNorth/wiki/Kortisto) and then pressing the Dialog button at the top.

On the page you will see the following buttons at the top:
 * **Save**: Saves the current dialog
 * **Mark as implemented**: This button will only be visible if you are a member of the Implementation Status Tracker role. If the current dialog is not implemented you can click on this button to see the changes to the dialog and flag it as implemented. If the current dialog is already implemented this button will be labeled with implemented and be disabled.
 * **Statistics**: This displays a dialog which shows dialog statistics. See below for details.
 * **Back to npc**: By clicking this button you will return to the npc to which the dialog belongs.
